SAS Data Sets
1.Descriptor Portion
2.Data Portion

The CONTENTS procedure displays the descriptor portion of a SAS data set.

The descriptor portion contains the metadata of the data set.

There are two types of variables:
1.character contain any value: letters, numbers, special
characters, and blanks. Character values
are stored with a length of 1 to 32,767
bytes. One byte equals one character.
2.numeric stored as floating point numbers in 8 bytes
of storage by default. Eight bytes of floating
point storage provide space for 16 or 17
significant digits. You are not restricted to
8 digits.

SAS names
􀂄 can be 32 characters long.
􀂄 can be uppercase, lowercase, or mixed-case.
􀂄 must start with a letter or underscore. Subsequent
characters can be letters, underscores, or numeric
digits.

SAS stores date values as numeric values.
A SAS date value is stored as the number of days between
January 1, 1960, and a specific date.

A character missing value is displayed as a blank.
A numeric missing value is displayed as a period.

SAS statements
􀂄 usually begin with an identifying keyword
􀂄 always end with a semicolon

Avoid placing the /* comment symbols in columns 1 and 2. On some
operating environments, SAS may interpret these symbols as a request to end
the SAS job or session.

An additional method used for commenting one line of code is to use the
asterisk at the beginning of the comment. Everything that is between the
asterisk and the semicolon is a comment.

What are the two major parts of SAS output?


Syntax errors include
􀂄 misspelled keywords
􀂄 missing or invalid punctuation
􀂄 invalid options.

When SAS encounters a syntax error, SAS underlines the error and the following
information is written to the SAS log:
• the word ERROR or WARNING
• the location of the error
• an explanation of the error.
