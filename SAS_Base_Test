QUESTION 2
When the following SAS program is submitted, the data set SASDATA.PRDSALES
contains 5000 observations:
libnamesastemp 'SAS-data-library';
options obs = 500;
proc print data = sasdata.prdsales (firsttobs = 100);
run;
options obs = max;
proc means data = sasdata.prdsales (firsttobs = 500);
run;
How many observations are processed by each procedure?
A. 400 for PROC PRINT
4500 for PROC MEANS
B. 401 for PROC PRINT
4501 for PROC MEANS
C. 401 for PROC PRINT
4500 for PROC MEANS
D. 500 for PROC PRINT
5000 for PROC MEANS
Answer: B

SAS 提供了多种方法提取表的前 N 条数据。
1）options obs=N;
这是个全局选项，一旦设置会对所有读表的操作起作用。不用改代码，很方便，但是有比较大的隐患。

The following SAS program is submitted:
data work.sets;
do until (prod gt 6);
prod + 1;
end;
run;
Which one of the following is the value of the variable PROD in the output data set?
A. 5
B. 6
C. 7
D. 8
Answer: C

data WORK.PRODUCTS;
   Prod=1;
   do until(Prod LE 6);
     Prod + 1;
   end;
 run;
那么PROD=2，为什么等于2？
因为DO UNTIL是执行后再判断，PROD执行一次之后变成2,2 LE 6是true，所以终止执行！。
UNTIL里面的表达式是循环终止的判断条件，如果UNTIL里面为真，那么就终止执行DO LOOP；
而WHILE的表达式是循环继续的判断条件，为真继续执行DO LOOP。

英文解释：
The DO UNTIL statement executes statements in a DO loop repetitively until a condition is true,
checking the condition after each iteration of the DO loop. The DO WHILE statement evaluates the
condition at the top of the loop; the DO UNTIL statement evaluates the condition at the bottom of the loop.
