QUESTION 2
When the following SAS program is submitted, the data set SASDATA.PRDSALES
contains 5000 observations:
libnamesastemp 'SAS-data-library';
options obs = 500;
proc print data = sasdata.prdsales (firsttobs = 100);
run;
options obs = max;
proc means data = sasdata.prdsales (firsttobs = 500);
run;
How many observations are processed by each procedure?
A. 400 for PROC PRINT
4500 for PROC MEANS
B. 401 for PROC PRINT
4501 for PROC MEANS
C. 401 for PROC PRINT
4500 for PROC MEANS
D. 500 for PROC PRINT
5000 for PROC MEANS
Answer: B

SAS 提供了多种方法提取表的前 N 条数据。
1）options obs=N;
这是个全局选项，一旦设置会对所有读表的操作起作用。不用改代码，很方便，但是有比较大的隐患。

The following SAS program is submitted:
data work.sets;
do until (prod gt 6);
prod + 1;
end;
run;
Which one of the following is the value of the variable PROD in the output data set?
A. 5
B. 6
C. 7
D. 8
Answer: C

data WORK.PRODUCTS;
   Prod=1;
   do until(Prod LE 6);
     Prod + 1;
   end;
 run;
那么PROD=2，为什么等于2？
因为DO UNTIL是执行后再判断，PROD执行一次之后变成2,2 LE 6是true，所以终止执行！。
UNTIL里面的表达式是循环终止的判断条件，如果UNTIL里面为真，那么就终止执行DO LOOP；
而WHILE的表达式是循环继续的判断条件，为真继续执行DO LOOP。

英文解释：
The DO UNTIL statement executes statements in a DO loop repetitively until a condition is true,
checking the condition after each iteration of the DO loop. The DO WHILE statement evaluates the
condition at the top of the loop; the DO UNTIL statement evaluates the condition at the bottom of the loop.

EQ = equal to

   var state day price1 price2; where state='NC';
   label state='Name of State'; run; 
a. three 
b. four 
c. five 
d. six 


Correct answer:  c
 
  Your answer:   
  
The five statements are: 1) the PROC PRINT statement (two lines long); 2) the VAR statement; 3) the WHERE statement (on the same line as the VAR statement); 4) the LABEL statement; and 5) the RUN statement (on the same line as the LABEL statement).

What is a SAS library?

a. a collection of SAS files, such as SAS data sets and catalogs 
b. in some operating environments, a physical collection of SAS files 
c. in some operating environments, a logically related collection of SAS files 
d. all of the above 


Correct answer:   d 
 
  Your answer:   
  
Every SAS file is stored in a SAS library, which is a collection of SAS files, such as SAS data sets and catalogs. In some operating environments, a SAS library is a physical collection of files. In others, the files are only logically related. In the Windows and UNIX environments, a SAS library is typically a group of SAS files in the same folder or directory.  

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which SAS windows perform these tasks (in the order given)?


perform most file management tasks such as moving, copying, and deleting files 

navigate and manage output from SAS programs 

enter, edit, and submit SAS programs

view messages about your SAS session and about any SAS programs that you submit

browse output from SAS programs 
a. Program Editor, Log, Results, SAS Notepad, Output, Explorer  
b. Explorer, Results, enhanced Editor or Program Editor, Log, Output  
c. File Shortcuts, Explorer, enhanced Editor or Program Editor, Log, Results  
d. Results, Output, enhanced Editor or Program Editor, Log, Explorer  


Correct answer:  b
 
  Your answer:   
  
You use the Explorer window for managing SAS files; the Results window for navigating and managing output; the enhanced Editor or Program Editor window for working with SAS programs; the Log window for viewing messages; and the Output window for browsing output.  

-----------------------------------------------------------


File shortcuts 
a. remain in effect until you submit the file.  
b. enable you to open, browse, and submit files.  
c. are available only for files that were created using SAS.  
d. are permanent shortcuts for accessing frequently used files.  


Correct answer:   b 
 
  Your answer:   
  
A file shortcut is a temporary, optional name that is used to identify an external file (a file that is created and maintained in your host operating environment, but which is not managed by SAS) to SAS. You can use shortcuts to open, browse, and submit files, and you can reference file shortcuts in your SAS programs.   

 
-----------------------------------------------------------



 In order for the date values 05May1955 and 04Mar2046 to be read correctly, what value must the YEARCUTOFF= option have? 
a. a value between 1947 and 1954, inclusive 
b. 1955 or higher 
c. 1946 or higher 
d. any value 


Correct answer:   d 
 
  Your answer:   
  
As long as you specify an informat with the correct field width for reading the entire date value, the YEARCUTOFF= option doesn't affect date values that have four-digit years.  





 Which time span is used to interpret two-digit year values if the YEARCUTOFF= option is set to 1950?

a. 1950-2049 
b. 1950-2050 
c. 1949-2050 
d. 1950-2000 


Correct answer:   a 
 
  Your answer:   
  
The YEARCUTOFF= option specifies which 100-year span is used to interpret two-digit year values. The default value of YEARCUTOFF= is 1920. However, you can override the default and change the value of YEARCUTOFF= to the first year of another 100-year span. If you specify YEARCUTOFF=1950, then the 100-year span will be from 1950 to 2049.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Assuming you are using SAS code and not special SAS windows, which one of the following statements is false? 
a. LIBNAME statements can be stored with a SAS program to reference the SAS library automatically when you submit the program. 
b. When you delete a libref, SAS no longer has access to the files in the library. However, the contents of the library still exist on your operating system.  
c. Librefs can last from one SAS session to another. 
d. You can access files that were created with other vendors' software by submitting a LIBNAME statement. 


Correct answer:  c
 
  Your answer:   
  

The LIBNAME statement is global, which means that librefs remain in effect until you modify them, cancel them, or end your SAS session. Therefore, the LIBNAME statement assigns the libref for the current SAS session only. You must assign a libref before accessing SAS files that are stored in a permanent SAS data library.

 Which PROC PRINT step below creates the following output?

Date On Changed Flight 
04MAR99 232 18 219 
05MAR99 160 4 219 
06MAR99 163 14 219 
07MAR99 241 9 219 
08MAR99 183 11 219 
09MAR99 211 18 219 
10MAR99 167 7 219 

a. proc print data=flights.laguardia noobs;
   var on changed flight;
   where on>=160;
run;
 
b. proc print data=flights.laguardia;
   var date on changed flight;
   where changed>3;
run;
 
c. proc print data=flights.laguardia label;
   id date;
   var boarded transferred flight;
   label boarded='On' transferred='Changed';
   where flight='219';
run;
 
d. proc print flights.laguardia noobs;
    id date;
    var date on changed flight;
    where flight='219';
run;
 


Correct answer:   c 
 
  Your answer:   
  
The DATA= option specifies the data set that you are listing, and the ID statement replaces the Obs column with the specified variable. The VAR statement specifies variables and controls the order in which they appear, and the WHERE statement selects rows based on a condition. The LABEL option in the PROC PRINT statement causes the labels specified in the LABEL statement to be displayed.  

 
------------------------------------------------

Which statement correctly re-defines the values of the variable Income as 100 percent higher? 
a. income=income*1.00;
 
b. income=income+(income*2.00);
 
c. income=income*2;
 
d. income=*2;
 


Correct answer:   c 
 
  Your answer:  a 
  
To re-define the values of the variable Income in an assignment statement, you specify the variable name on the left side of the equal sign and an appropriate expression including the variable name on the right side of the equal sign.  


--------------------------------------------------

 6.  

 At the end of the DATA step, three actions occur. The first two are: 
The values in the program data vector are written to the data set as an observation. 
Control returns to the top of the DATA step. 
What is the third action? 
a. The automatic variable _N_ is incremented by one. 
b. The DATA step stops execution. 
c. The descriptor portion of the data set is written. 
d. The values of variables in the program data vector are re-set to missing. 


Correct answer:   d 
 
  Your answer:  a 
  
By default, at the end of the DATA step, the program data vector is written to the data set, control returns to the top of the DATA step, and the values in the program data vector are set to missing. Automatic variables retain their values.  
 
----------------------------------------

When you define an order variable, 
a. the detail rows are ordered according to their formatted values. 
b. you can't create summary reports. 
c. PROC REPORT displays only the first occurrence of each order variable value in a set of rows that have the same value for all order variables. 
d. all of the above 


Correct answer:  d
 
  Your answer:  a 
  
Order variables do order rows according to the formatted values of the order variable, and PROC REPORT suppresses repetitious printing of order values. However, you can't use order variables in a summary report.  

 
---------------------------------------------------

What output does this PROC REPORT step produce? 
proc report data=sasuser.houses nowd;
   column style sqfeet bedrooms price;
run;
a. a list report ordered by values of the first variable in the COLUMN statement 
b. a summary report ordered by values of the first variable in the COLUMN statement 
c. a list report that displays a row for each observation in the input data set and which calculates the SUM statistic for numeric variables 
d. a list report that calculates the N (frequency) statistic for character variables 


Correct answer:   c 
 
  Your answer:  a 
  

By default, PROC REPORT displays character variables as display variables. A report that contains one or more display variables has a detail row for each observation in the data set. By default, PROC REPORT displays numeric variables as analysis variables, which are used to calculate the default statistic SUM.

 Which program contains an error?

a.     data clinic.stress(drop=timemin timesec);
       infile tests;
       input ID $ 1-4 Name $ 6-25 RestHR 27-29 MaxHR 31-33
             RecHR 35-37 TimeMin 39-40 TimeSec 42-43
             Tolerance $ 45;
       TotalTime=(timemin*60)+timesec;
       SumSec+totaltime;
    run;
 
b.     proc print data=clinic.stress;
       label totaltime='Total Duration of Test';
       format timemin 5.2;
       drop sumsec;
    run;
 
c.     proc print data=clinic.stress(keep=totaltime timemin);
       label totaltime='Total Duration of Test';
       format timemin 5.2;
    run;
 
d.     data clinic.stress;
       infile tests;
       input ID $ 1-4 Name $ 6-25 RestHR 27-29 MaxHR 31-33
             RecHR 35-37 TimeMin 39-40 TimeSec 42-43
             Tolerance $ 45;
       TotalTime=(timemin*60)+timesec;
       keep id totaltime tolerance;
    run;
 


Correct answer:   b 
 
  Your answer:  a 
  
To select variables, you can use a DROP or KEEP statement in any DATA step. You can also use the DROP= or KEEP= data set options following a data set name in any DATA or PROC step. However, you cannot use DROP or KEEP statements in PROC steps.  

 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------



 At the start of DATA step processing, during the compilation phase, variables are created in the program data vector (PDV), and observations are set to: 
a. blank 
b. missing 
c. 0 
d. there are no observations 


Correct answer:  d
 
  Your answer:  b 
  
At the bottom of the DATA step, the compilation phase is complete, and the descriptor portion of the new SAS data set is created. There are no observations because the DATA step has not yet executed.  

 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


One-to-One Reading
You can combine data sets with one-to-one reading by including multiple SET statements in a DATA step. When you perform one-to-one reading, the new data set contains all the variables from all the input data sets. If the data sets contain same-named variables, the values that are read in from the last data set replace those that were read in from earlier ones. The number of observations in the new data set is the number of observations in the smallest original data set. 

     data one2one;
        set a;
        set b;
     run;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 In the data set Work.Invest, what would be the stored value for Year? 
data work.invest;
   do year=1990 to 2004;
      Capital+5000;
      capital+(capital*.10);
   end;
run;
a. missing 
b. 1990 
c. 2004 
d. 2005 


Correct answer:  d
 
  Your answer:  d 
  
At the end of the fifteenth iteration of the DO loop, the value for Year is incremented to 2005. Because this value exceeds the stop value, the DO loop ends. At the bottom of the DATA step, the current values are written to the data set.  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 5.  

 Which of the following statements is false regarding the program shown below? 
data work.invest;
   do year=1990 to 2004;
      Capital+5000;
      capital+(capital*.10);
      output;
   end;
run;
a. The OUTPUT statement writes current values to the data set immediately. 
b. The stored value for Year is 2005. 
c. The OUTPUT statement overrides the automatic output at the end of the DATA step. 
d. The DO loop performs 15 iterations. 


Correct answer:   b 
 
  Your answer:  c 
  
The OUTPUT statement overrides the automatic output at the end of the DATA step. On the last iteration of the DO loop, the value of Year, 2004, is written to the data set. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------

For the first observation, what is the value of diff{i} at the end of the second iteration of the DO loop? 
Weight1 Weight2 Weight3 
192 200 215 
137 130 125 
220 210 213 


array wt{*} weight1-weight10;
array diff{9};
do i=1 to 9;
   diff{i}=wt{i+1}-wt{i};
end;
a. 15 
b. 10 
c. 8 
d. -7 


Correct answer:   a 
 
  Your answer:  a
